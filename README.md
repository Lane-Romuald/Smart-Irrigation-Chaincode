# Chaincode Hyperledger Fabric - IoT Irrigation System

## Description
This repository contains the source code for a Hyperledger Fabric chaincode used in an IoT-based irrigation system. The chaincode manages the transactions between IoT devices (sensors, actuators) and ensures secure, transparent data management related to irrigation needs and system state.

## Features
- Manage water distribution to plants based on real-time sensor data (humidity, temperature, etc.)
- Record irrigation events on the blockchain
- Enable secure, immutable, and decentralized data handling
- Monitor system performance and transaction history
- Support for query and update operations on asset states (e.g., moisture levels)

### Prerequisites
- Hyperledger Fabric v2.x
- Docker & Docker-Compose
- Node.js (for packaging chaincode if written in JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Fabric CLI tools
